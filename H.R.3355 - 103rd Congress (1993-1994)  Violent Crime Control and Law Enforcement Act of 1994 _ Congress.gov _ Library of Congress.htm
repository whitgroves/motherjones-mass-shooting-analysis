and Policing</b>
 - Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 - Amends
 the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Omnibus Act) to
 authorize the Attorney General to make grants to States, local 
governments, Indian tribal governments, other public and private 
entities, and multi-jurisdictional or regional consortia thereof to 
increase police presence, expand and improve cooperative efforts between
 law enforcement agencies (LEAs) and community members, and otherwise 
enhance public safety. </p><p>Authorizes such grants to be used for 
programs, projects, and other activities to:  (1) rehire law enforcement
 officers who have been laid off as a result of State and local budget 
reductions for deployment in community-oriented policing; (2) hire and 
train new, additional career law enforcement officers for deployment in 
community-oriented policing across the Nation; and (3) procure 
equipment, technology, or support systems, or pay overtime, if the grant
 applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that
 expenditures for such purposes would result in a specified increase in 
the number of officers deployed in community-oriented policing. </p><p>Sets
 limits on grants for equipment, technology and support systems.  
Authorizes grants to hire former members of the armed forces to serve as
 career law enforcement officers for deployment in community-oriented 
policing, particularly in communities that are adversely affected by a 
recent military base closing. </p><p>Sets forth provisions regarding:  
(1) additional authorized grant projects (such as providing specialized 
training to officers to enhance their conflict resolution, mediation, 
and other skills and developing new technologies to assist State and 
local LEAs in reorienting the emphasis of their activities from reacting
 to crime to preventing crime); (2) preferential consideration of 
applications for certain grants; (3) technical assistance; (4) matching 
fund requirements; (5) application requirements (including providing a 
long-term strategy and detailed implementation plan and demonstrating a 
specific public safety need); (6) grant renewal; (7) limitation on the 
use of funds; (8) performance evaluation; (9) revocation or suspension 
of funding; and (10) access by the Attorney General and Comptroller 
General for audits and examinations. </p><p>Authorizes appropriations. </p><p><b>Title II:  Prisons - Subtitle A:  Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants</b>
 - Authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to individual States 
and to States organized as multi-State compacts to develop, expand, 
modify, operate, or improve correctional facilities and programs, 
including boot camp facilities and programs and other alternative 
confinement facilities and programs, to free conventional prison space 
for violent offenders. </p><p>Sets forth eligibility requirements.  
Directs the Attorney General, in making grants, to give consideration to
 the special burden placed on States which incarcerate a substantial 
number of inmates who are in the United States illegally. </p><p>(Sec. 
20102) Requires:  (1) 50 percent of the total amount of funds 
appropriated to carry out this subtitle for FY 1995 through 2000 to be 
made available for Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants (to be eligible a
 State must demonstrate that it requires that persons convicted of 
violent crimes serve not less than 85 percent of the sentence imposed or
 meet other specified requirements); and (2) 50 percent to be available 
for Violent Offender Incarceration Grants. </p><p>(Sec. 20104) Sets 
forth provisions regarding:  (1) matching requirements; (2) technical 
assistance and training; and (3) program evaluation. </p><p>(Sec. 20109) Authorizes appropriations. </p><p><b>Subtitle B:  Punishment for Young Offenders</b>
 - Authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to States for the 
purpose of developing alternatives to traditional forms of incarceration
 and probation for punishment of young offenders. Requires that such 
methods ensure certain punishment for young offenders and promote 
reduced recidivism, crime prevention, and victim assistance. </p><p>Sets
 forth provisions regarding:  (1) State and local application 
requirement; (2) allocation and distribution of funds; and (3) 
evaluation.  Authorizes appropriations. </p><p><b>Subtitle C:  Alien Incarceration</b>
 - Directs the Attorney General, upon written request by the chief 
executive officer of a State or political subdivision exercising 
authority regarding the incarceration of an undocumented criminal alien,
 to:  (1) enter into a contractual arrangement which provides for 
compensation to the State or political subdivision for such 
incarceration; or (2) take such alien into Federal custody. </p><p>Specifies
 that:  (1) such compensation shall be the average cost of incarceration
 of a prisoner in the relevant State; and (2) the Attorney General shall
 give priority to the Federal incarceration of undocumented criminal 
aliens who have committed aggravated felonies. </p><p>Requires the 
Attorney General to ensure that such undocumented criminal aliens are 
held in Federal facilities which provide a level of security appropriate
 to their crimes. </p><p>Authorizes appropriations. </p><p><b>Subtitle D:  Miscellaneous Provisions</b>
 - Prohibits applying favoritism in designating the place of 
imprisonment or in making transfers for prisoners of high social or 
economic status. </p><p>(Sec. 20402) Requires that any submission of 
legislation by the judicial or executive branch which could increase or 
decrease the number of persons incarcerated or in Federal penal 
institutions be accompanied by a prison impact statement. </p><p>(Sec. 
20403) Amends the Federal criminal code to direct the court, in 
determining a fine, to consider the expected costs to the Government of 
any imprisonment, supervised release, or probation sentence that is 
ordered. </p><p>(Sec. 20404) Provides that, in the case of a prisoner 
convicted of an offense committed prior to November 1, 1987, a reference
 under the code to supervised release shall be deemed to be a reference 
to probation or parole. </p><p>(Sec. 20405) Amends the Federal criminal 
code to repeal the requirement that credit toward service of sentence 
for satisfactory behavior ("good time") be granted to a prisoner serving
 a term of imprisonment of more than one year for a crime of violence.  
Allows a prisoner serving such a sentence, at the discretion of the 
Bureau of Prisons, to receive such credit if the prisoner has displayed 
exemplary compliance with institutional disciplinary regulations. </p><p>(Sec.
 20406) Requires the Director of the National Institute of Corrections 
to establish a task force on prison construction standardization 
techniques and cost-cutting new building materials and technologies. </p><p>Directs
 the task force:  (1) to work to promote the implementation of 
cost-saving efforts at the Federal, State, and local levels; (2) to 
advise on the results and effectiveness of adopted efforts; and (3) to 
certify the effectiveness of such efforts. </p><p>(Sec. 20407) Requires 
the Attorney General, in administering each grant program funded 
pursuant to this Act, to encourage:  (1) innovative methods for the 
low-cost construction and operation of facilities and the reduction of 
administrative cost and overhead expenses; and (2) the use of surplus 
Federal property. </p><p>Authorizes the Attorney General to assess the 
cost efficiency and utility of using modular, prefabricated, precast, 
and pre-engineered construction components and designs for housing 
nonviolent criminals. </p><p>(Sec. 20408) Amends the National Literacy 
Act of 1991 to authorize the Secretary of Education to convene and 
consult with a panel of experts in correctional education to:  (1) 
develop measures for evaluating the effectiveness of the literacy 
programs funded; and (2) evaluate the effectiveness of such programs. </p><p>(Sec.
 20409) Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit a Federal court 
from holding prison or jail crowding unconstitutional under the Eighth 
Amendment except to the extent that an individual plaintiff inmate 
proves that the crowding causes the infliction of cruel and unusual 
punishment of that inmate. Specifies that, in such cases, the relief 
shall extend no further than necessary to remove the conditions that are
 causing the cruel and unusual punishment of the plaintiff inmate. </p><p>Prohibits
 a Federal court from placing a ceiling on the inmate population of any 
Federal, State, or local detention facility as an equitable remedial 
measure for conditions that violate the Eighth Amendment unless crowding
 is inflicting cruel and unusual punishment on particular identified 
prisoners.  Leaves intact Federal judicial power to issue other 
equitable relief where appropriate, including the requirement of 
improved medical or health care and the imposition of civil contempt 
fines or damages. </p><p>Requires that each Federal court order or 
consent decree seeking to remedy an Eighth Amendment violation be 
reopened at the behest of a defendant for recommended modification at a 
minimum of two-year intervals. </p><p>(Sec. 20410) Prohibits expanding 
the existing prison facilities and complex at the District of Columbia 
Corrections Facility at Lorton, Virginia, without congressional 
approval.  Directs the Senate Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on
 the District of Columbia to conduct hearings regarding expansion of the
 prison complex in Lorton prior to any such approval, permitting 
interested parties (including appropriate Fairfax County officials) to 
testify. </p><p>(Sec. 20411) Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to 
prohibit awards of Pell Grants to any individual incarcerated in a 
Federal or State penal institution. </p><p>(Sec. 20412) Revises early 
release requirements under the Federal criminal code to provide that 
credit toward a prisoner's service of sentence shall not vest unless the
 prisoner has earned or is making satisfactory progress toward a high 
school diploma or an equivalent degree.  Directs the Attorney General to
 ensure that the Bureau of Prisons has in effect an optional General 
Educational Development (GED) program for inmates who have not earned a 
high school diploma or its equivalent (but permits exemptions to the GED
 requirement as deemed appropriate by the Director of the Bureau). </p><p>(Sec.
 20413) Requires the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General:  (1)
 to jointly study the suitability of military installations selected 
before this Act's enactment to be closed pursuant to a base closure law 
for conversion into Federal prison facilities. </p><p>Directs the 
Attorney General, in determining where to locate any new Federal prison 
facility and in accordance with the Department of Justice's (DOJ) duty 
to review and identify a use for any portion of an installation closed 
pursuant to specified provisions of the Defense Authorization Amendments
 and Base Closure and Realignment Act and the Defense Base Closure and 
Realignment Act of 1990, to consider whether:  (1) using any portion of 
such an installation provides a cost-effective alternative to the 
purchase of real property or construction of new prison facilities; (2) 
such use is consistent with a reutilization and redevelopment plan; and 
(3) the closure of any installation located in a rural area will have a 
substantial adverse impact on the economy of the local communities and 
on the ability of the communities to sustain an economic recovery from 
such closure.  Sets forth reporting requirements. </p><p>(Sec. 20414) 
Requires the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts 
(Administrative Office) to establish a program of drug testing of 
Federal offenders on post-conviction release. </p><p>(Sec. 20415) Amends
 the Internal Revenue Code to require every clerk of a Federal or State 
criminal court who receives more than $10,000 in cash as bail for any 
individual charged with a Federal criminal offense involving a 
controlled substance, racketeering, money laundering, and any 
substantially similar State criminal offense to make a return with 
respect to the receipt of such bail. </p><p>(Sec. 20416) Amends the 
Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act to increase the period for
 exhaustion of administrative remedies to up to 180 days (currently, 90
